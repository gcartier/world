;; NOTES
;; - replace last-point and last-time by using last-mouses
;; - could we more generally, hook at the camera change and smooth every camera change!?
;;   - hummm not so sure anymore. moving the mouse is a jerky process, whereas the other camera jerkyness
;;   - are probably more due to bugs that should be identified and corrected. if that's the case then rename to mouse-smoothing
;; - going horizontal, waiting a bit like .2 and going down looks really bad. need something more continuous than only considering scalar < 0
;; - we should take the angle between the movements instead of the scalar product so we can do a test like (> 30 degree) for example
